# face_antispoofing
this code takes surf feature to detect spoofing face in recognition.
1. the linear svm was selef contained, and you still need to configure two other libraries:
  Opencv3.+, vlfeat
2. after that run live demo

3. this code is implemented using c/c++ according to my understanding to  [<< Face Anti-Spoofing using Speeded-Up Robust Features and Fisher Vector Encoding >> ](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7748511/?reload=true), thanks the authors, and you can read this paper if need.
